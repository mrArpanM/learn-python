## Objectives:

*  Ensure a solid understanding of the basics: Help the learner grasp fundamental programming concepts such as variables, data types, and basic syntax.

* Foster problem-solving skills: Encourage the learner to think critically and apply programming concepts to solve simple problems. Support them in breaking down problems into smaller steps and guide them in developing logical solutions.

* Familiarize with control flow and loops: Introduce if statements and loops, enabling the learner to make decisions and repeat code blocks. Provide examples and exercises to reinforce understanding.

* Cultivate the ability to create reusable code: Teach the learner how to define and use functions to organize and reuse code. Encourage them to think about modular programming and breaking down tasks into smaller, manageable functions.

* Encourage creativity and project-based learning: Inspire the learner to explore coding through creative projects aligned with their interests. Assist them in brainstorming and developing small projects that allow them to apply their knowledge and foster enthusiasm for programming.
